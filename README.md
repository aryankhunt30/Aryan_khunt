Project Title: Customer Data Management System

Project Description:
The Customer Data Management System is a web-based application that empowers users to manage and manipulate data records within a digital environment. The system provides a user-friendly interface to create, read, update, and delete data entries, offering a comprehensive solution for effective data management.

Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication:
Users can register for an account or log in using their credentials.
Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access and manipulate data.

Dashboard:
Upon logging in, users are greeted with a dashboard that displays a summary of their data entries.

Create Data Records:
Users can add new data records to the system by filling out a form with relevant information.
Each data record typically contains fields and attributes that describe a particular entity or item.

Read Data Records:
Users can view a list of existing data records in a tabular or list format.
The system allows users to search, filter, and sort records for easy retrieval.

Update Data Records:
Users can edit and update existing data records to reflect changes or corrections.
The update feature ensures data accuracy and relevance.

Delete Data Records:
Users have the ability to delete data records that are no longer needed.
Deletion should be performed with caution, as it permanently removes records from the system.

Data Validation and Error Handling:
The system includes validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Error handling provides feedback to users when input is invalid or an operation fails.

User Permissions and Roles:
Depending on their role (e.g., admin, user, manager), users may have different levels of access and permissions within the system.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a frontend framework 
Backend: A web framework of Django, database MySQL and server-side scripting of python and node.js
Authentication: User authentication can be implemented using OAuth, JWT, or a similar mechanism.
Security: Security libraries and best practices should be employed to ensure the safety of user data.
Hosting: The project can be hosted on a web server (e.g., AWS, Heroku) and secured with SSL encryption.
